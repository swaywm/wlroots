  <description summary="control data devices">
    This protocol allows a privileged client to control data devices. In
    particular, the client will be able to manage the current selection and take
    the role of a clipboard manager.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    interface version number is reset.

        set. The wlr_data_control_offer is valid until a new
        wlr_data_control_offer or NULL is received. The client must destroy the
        previous selection wlr_data_control_offer, if any, upon receiving this
        event.

    <description summary="offer to transfer data">
      A wlr_data_control_offer represents a piece of data offered for transfer
      by another client (the source client). The offer describes the different
      MIME types that the data can be converted to and provides the mechanism
      for transferring the data directly from the source client.

    <request name="receive">
      <description summary="request that the data is transferred">
        To transfer the offered data, the client issues this request and
        indicates the MIME type it wants to receive. The transfer happens
        through the passed file descriptor (typically created with the pipe
        system call). The source client writes the data in the MIME type
        representation requested and then closes the file descriptor.

        The receiving client reads from the read end of the pipe until EOF and
        then closes its end, at which point the transfer is complete.

        This request may happen multiple times for different MIME types.
