  <description summary="screen content capturing on client buffers">
    This protocol allows clients to ask the compositor to copy part of the
    screen content to a client buffer.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    interface version number is reset.

    <description summary="a frame ready for copy">
      This object represents a surface that's being captured.

      After a screencopy surface is created, buffer_info events will be emitted
      from the compositor to tell the client which buffer types and formats are
      supported for reading from the surface.

      When the client knows all the buffer attributes, it can create a buffer,
      attach it to the screencopy surface using the "attach_buffer" request,
      set the buffer damage using the "damage_buffer" request and then call
      the "commit" request.

      After "commit" has been called, the next time that a buffer is committed
      by the compositor, the contents of that buffer will be copied to the one
      committed to the screencopy surface. A series of events will be generated,
      ending with the "ready" event, which means that the buffer is ready to be
      used and a buffer may be committed to the surface again.

      The "failed" event may be sent at any time. When this happens, the client
      must destroy the surface. Depending on the failure reason, the client can
      create a new surface to replace it.

        The timestamp is expressed as tv_sec_hi, tv_sec_lo, tv_nsec triples,

        tv_sec which is a 64-bit value combined from tv_sec_hi and tv_sec_lo,
        and the additional fractional part in tv_nsec as nanoseconds. Hence,
        for valid timestamps tv_nsec must be in [0, 999999999]. The seconds part
        may have an arbitrary offset at start.
