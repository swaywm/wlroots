  <description summary="a frame ready for readout">
    An interface to capture surfaces in an efficient way.
    Overall usage:

    1.) client registers with zwlr_screencontent_manager_v1
    2.) server sends client info about surfaces via "receive_surface_info"
    3.) client subscribes to capture a surface via the "capture" requests
    4.) server sends client events via the "zwlr_screencontent_frame" interface
    5.) client finishes and informs server via the "frame_destroy" event
    6.) client optionally resubscribes via repeating steps 3.) through 5.)

  <interface name="zwlr_export_dmabuf_frame_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="a frame ready for readout">
      This object represents a frame which is ready to have its resources
      fetched and used.

      The receive callback shall be called first, followed by either the
      "dma_object" callback once per object or the "dma_layer" callback,
      once per layer. The "dma_plane" callback shall only be called after
      the "dma_layer" callback corresponding to the layer the plane belongs
      to has been called. Finally, the "ready" event is called to indicate that
      all the data has been made available for readout, as well as the time
      at which presentation happened at.
      The ownership of the frame is passed to the client, who's responsible for
      destroying it via the "destroy" event once finished.
      The data the API describes has been based off of what
      VASurfaceAttribExternalBuffers contains.
      All frames are read-only and may not be written into or altered.

    <enum name="frame_flags">
      <description summary="frame flags">
        Special flags that must be respected by the client.
        Transient frames indicate short lifetime frames (such as swapchain
        images from external clients). Clients are advised to copy them and do
        all processing outside of the "ready" event.

    <event name="frame">
      <description summary="main callback">
        Main callback supplying the client with information about the frame,
        as well as an object to serve as context for destruction. Always called
        first before any other events.

        The "transform" argument describes the orientation needed to be applied
        to correctly orient the buffer. For example, a buffer rotated by 90
        degrees will have a value of "3" here, corresponding to the need to
        apply a 270 degree transpose to correctly present the buffer.
