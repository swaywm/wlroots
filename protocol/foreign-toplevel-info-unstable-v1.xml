    <description summary="list toplevels and properties thereof">
      The purpose of this protocol is to enable clients such as taskbars
      or docks to access a list of opened applications and basic properties
      thereof.

      The secondary purpose of this protocol is to provide protocol object
      handles for toplevels which may be used to address said toplevels in
      other protocols (e.g. to target a toplevel for screencopy).

      After a client binds the zext_foreign_toplevel_info_v1, each opened
      toplevel window will be sent via the toplevel event
    </description>

    <event name="toplevel">
      <description summary="a toplevel has been created">
        This event is emitted whenever a new toplevel window is created. It is
        emitted for all toplevels, regardless of the app that has created them.

        All initial properties of the toplevel (title, app_id, states, etc.)
        will be sent immediately after this event via the corresponding
        events in zext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1.

        This request indicates that the client no longer wishes to receive
        events for new toplevels.  However, the compositor may emit further
        toplevel_created events until the finished event is emitted.

        The client must not send any more requests after this one.

        This event indicates that the compositor is done sending events
        to the zext_foreign_toplevel_info_v1. The server will destroy the
        object immediately after sending this request, so it will become
        invalid and the client should free any resources associated with it.

    <description summary="an open toplevel">
      A zext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 object represents an open toplevel
      window.  A single app may have multiple open toplevels.

      Each toplevel has a list of outputs it is visible on, exposed to the
      client via the output_enter and output_leave events.

      <description summary="destroy the zext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 object">
        This request should be called either when the client will no longer
        use the zext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 or after the closed event
        has been received to allow destruction of the object.

        The server will emit no further events on the
        zext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 after this event. Any requests received
        aside from the destroy request will be ignored. Upon receiving this
        event, the client should make the destroy request to allow freeing
        of resources.

      <description summary="all information about the toplevel has been sent">
        This event is sent after all changes in the toplevel state have
        been sent.

        This allows changes to the zext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 properties
        to be seen as atomic, even if they happen via multiple events.

        Note: this is is not sent after the closed event.
