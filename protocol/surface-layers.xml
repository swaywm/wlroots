  <interface name="surface_layers" version="1">
    <description summary="create surfaces that are layers of the desktop">
      Clients can use this interface to assign the surface_layer role to
      wl_surfaces. Such surfaces are assigned to a "layer" of the output and
      rendered with a defined z-depth respective to each other. They may also be
      anchored to the edges and corners of a screen and specify input handling
      semantics. This interface should be suitable for the implementation of
      many desktop shell components, and a broad number of other applications
      that interact with the desktop.

        These values indicate which layers a surface can be rendered in. They
        are ordered by z depth, bottom-most first. Traditional shell surfaces
        will typically be rendered between the bottom and top layers.
        Fullscreen shell surfaces are typically rendered at the top layer.
        Multiple surfaces can share a single layer, and ordering within a
        single layer is undefined.

    <request name="set_interactivity">
      <description summary="indicates that this surface is interactive">
        This request indicates to the compositor what kind of interactivity
        this surface requires. This may be changed at runtime. Any inputs
        included in exclusive_types will not be given to other clients at lower
        depths. The compositor may choose under which circumstances to send
        inputs. By convention, the compositor will send input events to
        the top-most surface of the top-most layer.

    <request name="set_anchor">

        Requests that the compositor anchor the surface to the specified edges
        and corners. If two orthoginal edges are specified (e.g. 'top' and
        'left'), then the anchor point will be the intersection of the edges
        (e.g. the top left corner of the output); otherwise the anchor point
        will be centered on that edge, or in the center if none is specified.

    <request name="set_exclusive_zone">

        Requests that the compositor avoids occluding an area of the surface
        with other surfaces. The compositor's use of this information is
        implementation-dependent - do not assume that this region will not
        actually be occluded.

        This value is only meaningful if the surface is anchored to an edge,
        rather than a corner. The zone is the number of pixels from the edge
        that are considered exclusive.
