/**
 * wlr_layer_shell_v1 allows clients to arrange themselves in "layers" on the
 * desktop in accordance with the wlr-layer-shell protocol. When a client is
 * added, the new_surface signal will be raised and passed a reference to our
 * wlr_layer_surface_v1. At this time, the client will have configured the
 * surface as it desires, including information like desired anchors and
 * margins. The compositor should use this information to decide how to arrange
 * the layer on-screen, then determine the dimensions of the layer and call
 * wlr_layer_surface_v1_configure. The client will then attach a buffer and
 * commit the surface, at which point the wlr_layer_surface_v1 map signal is
 * raised and the compositor should begin rendering the surface.
