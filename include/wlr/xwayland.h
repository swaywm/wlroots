 * When such a window wants to receive keyboard input (e.g. rofi/dzen) it will
 * use mechanics we don't support (sniffing/grabbing input).
 * [Sadly this is unrelated to xwayland-keyboard-grab]
 *
 * To still support these windows, while keeping general OR semantics as is, we
 * need to hand a subset of windows focus.
 * The dirty truth is, we need to hand focus to any Xwayland window, though
 * pretending this window has focus makes it easier to handle unmap.
 *
 * This function provides a handy metric based on the window type to guess if
 * the OR window wants focus.
 * It's probably not perfect, nor exactly intended but works in practice.
 *
 * Returns: true if the window should receive focus
 *          false if it should be ignored
